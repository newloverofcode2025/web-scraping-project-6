🕸️ **Web Scraping Project 6: E-commerce Product Listings Scraper** 🕸️

🚀 **Overview**
Welcome to the sixth project in our web scraping series! 🎉 This project takes web scraping to the next level by extracting detailed product information from an e-commerce site and saving it to a JSON file. We'll scrape product details, including titles, prices, descriptions, and images, and handle pagination to scrape multiple pages. Additionally, we'll address SSL certificate verification issues to ensure smooth data extraction. This project is perfect for those looking to deepen their web scraping skills and work with more advanced data structures.

📂 **Project Structure**
Here’s how the project is organized:
Copy
web-scraping-project-6/
├── src/
│   └── main.py
├── data/
│   └── products.json
└── README.md
src/: Contains the Python script (main.py) that performs the web scraping.
data/: Stores the output JSON file (products.json) containing the scraped data.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

📚 **Dependencies**
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
requests: For making HTTP requests to the website.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content.
json: For saving data to a JSON file.
You can install these dependencies using pip:
bashCopy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

🛠️ **Setup**
Follow these steps to get started:
Clone the Repository:
bashCopy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-project-6.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
bashCopy
cd web-scraping-project-6
Install Dependencies:
bashCopy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Run the Script:
bashCopy
python src/main.py

🎯 Usage
The script main.py performs the following steps:
Fetches the Website Content:
Sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.
Parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
Extracts Relevant Data:
Extracts product details such as titles, prices, descriptions, and images from the HTML.
Handles Pagination:
Scrapes multiple pages to collect a comprehensive dataset.
Saves Data to JSON:
Uses the json library to save the extracted data to a JSON file (data/products.json).
SSL Certificate Handling:
Bypasses SSL certificate verification issues to ensure smooth data extraction.
🎯 **Example**
To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:
bashCopy
python src/main.py
This will scrape the specified e-commerce site and save the extracted data to data/products.json.

📝 **Notes**
URL Modification: You can modify the URL in main.py to scrape different e-commerce sites.
Data Extraction: Customize the data extraction logic in main.py to scrape different elements from the site.
Permissions: Ensure you have permission to scrape the website and comply with its robots.txt file.
SSL Handling: The script includes logic to bypass SSL certificate verification issues, but use this cautiously and ethically.
