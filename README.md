# web-scraping-project-6
 I will create a web scraper that extracts data from a website with a more complex structure, such as a product listing site. We'll scrape product details, including titles, prices, descriptions, and images, and save this data to a JSON file. This project will introduce you to handling more complex HTML structures and extracting data from multiple pages.
